DESCRIPTION="
32-bit sparc

Sparc was a risc processor design Sun Microsystems came up with to replace
m68k in their Unix workstations.  With the advent of OpenSolaris and
x86-64, Fujitsu mainframes may now use more of it than they do.

This has been broken for a couple years, and nobody's bothered to fix it.
