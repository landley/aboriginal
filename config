# Setup

# This file is a place for you to set configuration values.  This entire
# file is optional; by default all the variables documented in this file
# are left blank by the build.  Feel free to replace this file with your
# own version, or to set these as environment variables on the command line.

# By default root-filesystem.sh will build a native toolchain (binutils, gcc,
# make, bash, distcc).  Set this variable to "none" to skip all that, and
# build a root filesystem containing only uClibc and busybox.  You can also
# set it to "headers" to retain the linux/uClibc kernel headers (in case you'd
# like to build your own native toolchain based on a different compiler).

# export NATIVE_TOOLCHAIN=none
# export NATIVE_TOOLCHAIN=headers

# If this is set, root-filesystem will build a Linux From Scratch style /tools
# directory instead of a more conventional filesystem layout in /usr.

# export NATIVE_TOOLSDIR=1

# If this is set, the build records the command lines run by each build into
# log files in the build directory, ala "build/cmdlines.$PACKAGENAME"

# export RECORD_COMMANDS=1

# If this is set, the cross-compiler stage is compiled with --static.

# export CROSS_BUILD_STATIC=1

# This may be set by the target's "details" file, but you can override it here.
# You can set it to ext2, initramfs, or squashfs.  It defaults to ext2 if blank.

# export SYSIMAGE_TYPE=ext2

# Size of writeable HDA image (if any), defaults to 64 megs

# export SYSIMAGE_HDA_MEGS=64

# Set this to use symlinks instead of hard links when creating temporary copies
# of the source packages (in setupfor).  This is slower and uses more inodes,
# but allows the extracted source packages to live in a different filesystem
# than the build directory.

# export SNAPSHOT_SYMLINK=1

# Set this to build packages the host system doesn't need in order to build
# a cross compiler, root filesystem, or system image, but which is needed
# to boot a system image with run-emulator.sh.  Specifically, this means
# building qemu and e2fsprogs.  (Note that the qemu build takes a very long
# time and consumes a lot of memory.)

# If you don't enable this, host-tools.sh will attempt to symlink these
# commands out of the host $PATH, although it won't fail if it can't find
# them (unlink symlinking the host toolchain).

# export HOST_BUILD_EXTRA=1

# Use qemu to run "hello world" built by the cross compiler.  Note that
# you need a working qemu application emulation to do this.  Specifically,
# to unbreak arm you need to "echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr" as root.

# export CROSS_SMOKE_TEST=1

# If this is set, try downloading packages from this location first.

# export PREFERRED_MIRROR=http://impactlinux.com/fml/mirror

# If this is set, the toybox utilities will take precedence over busybox ones.

# export USE_TOYBOX=1

# Try development versions of these packages.  (Know what you're doing if
# you select these, it's quite possible the result won't work.)

# export USE_UNSTABLE=uClibc,busybox,toybox,linux,binutils,make,gcc-core,gcc-g++

# Debugging option to leave source in build/temp-$ARCH after build.
# export NO_CLEANUP=1

# Don't create tarballs at the end of each stage.
# export SKIP_STAGE_TARBALLS=1

# If this is set, the output of the various stages will be color coded.
# export USE_COLOR=1
