This is a brief intro, see http://impactlinux.com/fwl/documentation.html for
full documentation.

--- What is it?

Firmware Linux (FWL) is a build system that creates cross compilers and
bootable system images for various targets, such as arm, mips, powerpc, and
x86.

--- How do I use it?

List available targets:

  ./build.sh

Build the mipsel (mips little endian) target:

  ./build.sh mipsel

Boot the result under qemu, right out of the build directory:

  ./run-from-build.sh mipsel

After the kernel boot messages scroll by, you should have a shell prompt
inside qemu.  Try "cat /proc/cpuinfo" to confirm it's not the same as your
host.  Type "exit" to shut it down.

Finally, look at the output in the "build" directory.

  ls -l build/*.tar.bz2

For each target you built, the build tars up the cross compiler, the
root filesystem, and a bootable system image.  Each system image contains an
ext2 formatted virtual hard drive image, a kernel configured for qemu, and a
run-emulator.sh shell script to invoke qemu in various ways.

If you'd like to use the cross compiler to build something else, just add
its "bin" subdirectory to the $PATH, and use the build tools prefixed with
the target name:

  PATH=$(pwd)/build/cross-compiler-mipsel/bin:$PATH
  mipsel-gcc -static hello.c -o hello
  qemu-mipsel hello

Note that the run-emulator.sh script has several command line options:

  cd build/system-image-mipsel
  ./run-emulator.sh --help

If you'd like to build every target in parallel (needs about 2 gigs of ram):

  ./buildall.sh --fork

The file "configure" contains several environment variables you can set to
control the behavior of FWL.  (If this file doesn't set them, you can set
them in your environment before running a build.)

--- What's it for?

Although Firmware Linux creates reusable cross compilers, the purpose of FWL
is actually to eliminate the need for cross compiling.

The FWL build does all the cross compiling necessary to create a minimal
native development environment (mini-native) for a target, then packages
it into a system image.  Once that target system is up and running (usually
under qemu), you can build your software natively in there, and no longer
need to cross compile anything from the host.

FWL is also designed to be readable.  The build is a series of bash scripts,
with comments where necessary.  They document how to make a cross compiler,
how to create a simple development environment, and how to package and boot
the result under an emulator.  If you don't know how something works, read
the script.  If something's unclear, ask us.

--- How does it work?

The build.sh script is a wrapper around other scripts.  The main three are:

  cross-compiler.sh - creates a cross compiler for the target.

  mini-native.sh - use the cross compiler to build a root filesystem.

  system-image.sh - build a kernel and ext2 image to run under emulator.

    # Or when building a cross-compile aware package, do something like:
    #   export PATH=`pwd`/build/cross-compiler-i686/bin:$PATH
    #   make CROSS_COMPILE=i686-
